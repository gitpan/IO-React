IO::React provides an interface for interacting with whatever may be
connected to an IO::Handle.  Typical usage of this module would
include automated interaction with telnet.  This is similar to
'expect'.

This module has not been tested on versions of Perl prior to 5.6.0.
It may not function correctly.  If you plan to use it with an older
version you will need to edit out the 'require 5.6.0' statement.

After unpacking the distribution, to install this module run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Documentation is embedded in the module.
